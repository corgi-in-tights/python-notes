# Question 1: Understanding If Statements

# Explain the difference between using:
# 1. Multiple independent if statements
# 2. if-elif-else chain

# Scenario: A grading system that checks a score

# Version A:
# if score >= 90:
#     print("A")
# if score >= 80:
#     print("B")
# if score >= 70:
#     print("C")

# Version B:
# if score >= 90:
#     print("A")
# elif score >= 80:
#     print("B")
# elif score >= 70:
#     print("C")

# Questions:
# 1. What happens in Version A if score = 95?
# 2. What happens in Version B if score = 95?
# 3. Which version is correct for a grading system? Why?
# 4. When would you use multiple independent if statements instead?
