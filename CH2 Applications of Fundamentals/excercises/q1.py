# Question 1: Conditional Logic Explanations

# Answer the following questions about how conditional logic works:

# -----------------------------
# Question 1A: Independence
# -----------------------------

# What will this code print if x = 15?

# if x > 10:
#     print("A")
# if x > 5:
#     print("B")
# if x > 0:
#     print("C")

# Explain why it prints what it does.


# -----------------------------
# Question 1B: Precedence
# -----------------------------

# Evaluate these expressions (True or False?) and explain the order of operations:

# 1. not True or False
# 2. True or False and False
# 3. 10 > 5 and not False or 3 < 2

# Hint: Remember operator precedence - which operators are evaluated first?
