# Question 3: Try-Catch Practice

# Write a program that:
# 1. Asks the user for two numbers
# 2. Divides the first number by the second
# 3. Prints the result

# Handle these errors:
# - ValueError: if the user enters something that's not a number
# - ZeroDivisionError: if the user tries to divide by zero

# For each error, print a helpful message explaining what went wrong.

# Example output:
# Enter first number: 10
# Enter second number: 2
# Result: 5.0

# Example with error:
# Enter first number: abc
# Please enter a valid number!
