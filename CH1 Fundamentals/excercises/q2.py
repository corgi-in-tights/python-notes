# Task: Return the area of a rectangle using the given width and height variables as inputs.
# All inputs will be *valid* floats, i.e., float(inp) will work without errors. Your output (what you print)
# should be a single float.

# i.e, given 3.5 and 8.0 as inputs respectively, your output should be 28.0

# width = whatever the user inputs, converted into a float
# height = whatever the user inputs, converted into a float

# then, return the area as width * height
