# Question 3: Shopping Cart with While Loop

# Create a shopping cart system that:
# 1. Starts with an empty cart list
# 2. Uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for items
# 3. If user types "done", exit the loop using break
# 4. If user types "remove", ask which item to remove and remove it
# 5. Otherwise, add the item to the cart
# 6. After the loop, print the final cart and total number of items

# Example interaction:
# Enter item (or 'done' to finish): milk
# Enter item (or 'done' to finish): eggs
# Enter item (or 'done' to finish): remove
# What to remove? milk
# Enter item (or 'done' to finish): bread
# Enter item (or 'done' to finish): done
# Final cart: ['eggs', 'bread']
# Total items: 2
